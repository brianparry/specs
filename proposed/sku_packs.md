# SKU Packs

## Background

Feedback from users indicated:
* The need to override default functionality with SKU specific functionality.  
* The need to dynamically load SKU specific content without having to bundle it with RackHD.

## Goals

* Provide a method within RackHD to override default functionality with SKU specific functionality.  
* Provide a method within RackHD to dynamically load SKU specific content without having to bundle it with RackHD.
* Documenting the SKU pack format and any manifests associated with it 
* Provide at least 1, if not a couple, of SKU packs 
* Create light (developer oriented notes) documentation on how to assemble a SKU pack and add it to the RackHD user's guide (in ttps://github.com/RackHD/docs/tree/master/docs/rackhd)
* Update the demo in https://github.com/RackHD/RackHD/tree/master/example to use a SKU pack instead of the piecemeal stuff we provide for Auto-install setup of CoreOS for virtualbox
